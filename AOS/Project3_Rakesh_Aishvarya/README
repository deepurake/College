FILES:
	constants.hpp 
		contains all the constants declared. Defining debug variable here enables debug messages.
	HashMapList.cpp
		contains the hashmap datastructure
	LinkedList.cpp
		containst the linked list implentation
	page_client.cpp
		contains the code for client end of the RPC that uses normal random distribution to select its url from the list
	page_client_uniform.cpp
		contains the code for client end of the RPC that uses uniform random distribution to select its url from the list
	page_server.cpp
		contains the code for server end of the RPC
	run
		contains the batch script for compiling the project, cleaning the ports for the server to run and starting server loops
	run_client
		This batch script executes the client test cases for normal distributed client
	run_client_uniform
		this batch file execues the client test cases for uniform distributed client
		
COMPILATION:

Executing the server
	./pageserver $policy $size_inKB
	policy 0 -- Random cache policy
				 1 -- FIFO
				 2 -- LRU
				 3 -- No caching to be used
				 
Executing the client with normal distribution
	./pageclient
	or ./pageclient <IP> <port> (for accessing server on different machine)
	
Executing the client with uniform random distribution 
	./pageclient_uniform
	or ./pageclient_uniform <IP> <port> (for accessing server on different machine)
